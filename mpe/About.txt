= Internals

Each script uses clog2_print to get a text version of the CLOG
The reader should look at the output of clog2_print -
it is a moderately readable key/value format

Each script reads definitions using an mpe.tcl utility
Then, the log is read again for script-specific events

Then, statistics are collected and output is generated.
